# Automate your Documentation with Gitlab and Mkdocs


> Producing documentation may be painful and need a lot of time to write and operate. In this story, i will share with you, my way of generating docs using the devops approach. To make life easier, we will explore the art of automation üòÉ.

> Let‚Äôs go folks üòô

# Create a Gitlab repo

This is straightforward, follow these steps:

*   Log in to your GitLab
*   Click new project
*   Give it a name: `auto_docs`
*   Initialize it with a `README.md` file
*   Make it public or private
*   Hit create

Now clone the project by copying the URL and run this command :


```
$ git clone [https://gitlab.com/auto_docs.git](https://gitlab.com/auto_docs.git)</span>
```


# Setting up the environment

I‚Äôm using a Linux environment but it is possible to reproduce the same steps on a Windows machine.

In order to follow me, you need a set of tools that must be available on your machine ‚Ä¶ make sure to to have `python3` installed, I have python 3.8 (latest).

## Creating a virtual environment

The easiest way to set up a virtual environment is to install `virtualenv` python package by executing `pip install virtualenv` .

Navigate to your local GitLab repository and create a new virtual environment.


```
$ cd auto_docs/
$ virtualenv autodocs
$ source autodocs/bin/acivate</span>
```


## Installing Mkdocs Material

Make sure that the virtual environment is active.

Install the mkdocs material with this command : `pip install mkdocs-material.`
This package needs some dependencies to work .. install them by using a requirement.txt file, copy-paste the dependencies list to filename `requirements.txt`


```
Babel==2.8.0
click==7.1.1
future==0.18.2
gitdb==4.0.4
GitPython==3.1.1
htmlmin==0.1.12
Jinja2==2.11.2
joblib==0.14.1
jsmin==2.2.2
livereload==2.6.1
lunr==0.5.6
Markdown==3.2.1
MarkupSafe==1.1.1
mkdocs==1.1
mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin==2.2.1
mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin==0.5.0
mkdocs-material==5.1.1
mkdocs-material-extensions==1.0b1
mkdocs-minify-plugin==0.3.0
nltk==3.5
Pygments==2.6.1
pymdown-extensions==7.0
pytz==2019.3
PyYAML==5.3.1
regex==2020.4.4
six==1.14.0
smmap==3.0.2
tornado==6.0.4
tqdm==4.45.0</span>
```


Install them all with one command : `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Now it‚Äôs time to create a new mkdocs project üòÖ.

Run this command : `mkdocs new .` and verify that you have this structure :


```
|--auto_docs
    |--- docs
    |--- mkdocs.yml</span>
```


*   The **docs** folder contains the structure of your documentation, it contains subfolders and markdown files.
*   The **mkdocs.yml** file defines the configuration of the generated site.

Let's test the installation by running this command : `mkdocs serve` . The site will be accessible on [http://locahost:8000](http://locahost:8000) and you should see the initial look of the docs.

# Setting up the CI/CD

let‚Äôs enable le CI/CD to automate the build and the deployment of the docs. Notice that GitLab offers a feature called `gitlab pages` that can serve for free a static resource (HTML, js, CSS). The repo path is converted to an URL to your docs.

## Create the CI/CD file

Gitlab uses a YAML file ‚Äî it holds the pipeline configuration.

The CI file content:


```
stages :
  - build</span><span id="3031" class="fu lb ji ex kt b lc mb mc md me mf le s lf">pages:
  stage: build
  image:
  name: squidfunk/mkdocs-material
  entrypoint:
    - ""
  script:
    - mkdocs build
    - mv site public
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public
  only:
    - master
  tags:
    - gitlab-org-docker</span>
```


This pipeline uses a docker executor with an image that contains `mkdocs` already installed‚Ä¶ mkdocs build the project and put the build assets on a folder called `site` ‚Ä¶ to be able to use GitLab pages you have to name your job `pages` and put the site assets into a new folder called `public.`

For tags: check the runner's section under **settings ‚Üí CI/CD ‚ÜíRunners** and pick one of the shared runners that have a tag _GitLab-org-docker._

All things were done üéâ üéâ üò∏ !

Oh ! just one thing ‚Ä¶ we forgot the virtual environment files .. they are big and not needed on the pipeline ‚Ä¶ they are for the local development only. The mkdocs image on the pipeline is already shipped with the necessary packages.

So ‚Ä¶ create a new file called `.gitignore` and add these lines:


```
auto_docs/ 
requirements.txt</span>
```


The **auto_docs** folder has the same name as the virtual environment .. don't forget üò†! you will be punished by pushing +100Mi üòù and you will wait your whole life to complete the process haha üò¢.

Now run `git add . && git commit -m "initial commit" a && git push` ‚Ä¶ go to your GitLab repo and click **CI/CD ‚Üí pipelines,** click on the blue icon and visualize the logs .. once the job succeeded, navigate to **settings -> pages** and click the link of your new documentation site (you have to wait for 10m~ to be accessible)

> Finally, I hope this was helpful ! thanks for reading üò∫ üòç!
